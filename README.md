# Terminal-RicePurityScore

**This was tested on Python 3.9.**

## What does this do?
> This uses **Python** to replicate the [Rice Purity Test Score Site](http://ricepuritytest.com) as a terminal.

> This only supports Windows. Unfortunately this hasn't been tested for other OS so Linux and Mac users should test if it works or not.

## Prerequisites
- [Python 3.9+](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Usage
> All you need to do is have main.py in a folder, then open it with [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads).

> Afterwards, run ``py main.py`` and have fun!
